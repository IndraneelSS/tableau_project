# PROJECT OVERVIEW:

This project aims to conduct a comprehensive visual exploration of natural disasters and their economic and human impacts in the United States from 2000 to 2020. The study employs data-driven analyses and visualization techniques to elucidate the frequency, severity, regional distribution, and economic consequences of various natural disasters during the specified timeframe.

### 1. Exploring USA's Natural Disasters: Monthly and Yearly Insights with County Mapping:
This dashboard provides detailed analyses of natural disasters at the county level, focusing on monthly and yearly trends. It highlights the counties in the United States that have experienced the most disasters within a specified timeframe, allowing users to quickly identify hotspots of disaster activity and understand the challenges faced by these high-risk areas.

### 2. Charting Disaster Dynamics: Mapping Frequency, Recovery Times, and Regional Patterns:
The purpose of this dashboard is to visually map disaster categories and subcategories across states in the USA, along with average recovery times for each disaster type. The interactive map represents different disaster categories (e.g., hurricanes, wildfires, floods) and their occurrences in various states.

### 3. Exposing Human Loss: Analyzing Natural Disaster Impact Across the USA:
Embark on a journey to understand the profound human impact of natural disasters in the USA from 2000 to 2023. Witness the evolution of mortality rates, injuries, homelessness, and overall human toll through interactive bar plots and comprehensive line graphs. Each visualization reveals the specific disasters and their associated human consequences, offering a nuanced perspective on the enduring challenges faced by communities across decades.

### 4. Impact Unveiled: Economic Consequences of Natural Disasters in the USA:
Experience a comprehensive analysis of the economic ramifications of natural disasters across the United States from 2013 to 2023. Explore detailed time series analyses showcasing the financial impact over time alongside specific disaster events. Navigate through our interactive map to understand county-wise economic repercussions, and delve into the top 5 states and their most affected counties for deeper insights into the extent of damage.
